        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages. 
        It provides the structure and content of a webpage, while CSS and JavaScript add 
        styling and interactivity, respectively.

        In this lab, I learned how to set up a basic HTML file, use essential tags like 
        &lt;h1&gt; for headings and &lt;p&gt; for paragraphs, and open the file in a 
        browser to see the results.
    </p>

        Web development is an exciting field that combines creativity and technical skills. 
        I look forward to learning more about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build 
        interactive and visually appealing websites.
